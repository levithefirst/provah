# Prova Pass — final status

Last updated: 2026-08-26 · **Submission-ready.**

## Live

- **Demo:** https://provah.vercel.app/ — shows all 3 live campaigns, backed
  by the deployed contract below.
- **Contract (`ProvaPass`):**
  `0x74614e0cd54af7e59987a5d74fdd028209feff01fc20eca2934fe80b94db402`
  (class hash `0x7adfeaf0d075cda33b3128fd9cc255e34e7b778e907cbb64216d76bd7cf89e6`)
- **Operating account** (OpenZeppelin single-signer, no guardian):
  `0x3b8fa185523ff035d5df73c55859a264ec39e3c72f8cb49fc2ee306ee842ede`

## Live campaigns (3, all on the same contract, no redeploy between them)

| Campaign | Predicate type | Claim kind |
|---|---|---|
| STRK Loyalty Drop | `held_since` (held ≥1 STRK for ≥7 days) | capability |
| STRK Holder Badge | `balance_threshold` (held ≥1 STRK, any time) | capability |
| Active Depositor | `deposit_count` (≥1 deposit into the pool) | capability |

This is the load-bearing architectural fact: `ProvaPass.cairo` never
validates what a campaign's predicate *was* — `claim_with_prova_pass` only
checks the attester's ECDSA signature over `(campaign_id, nullifier,
recipient)`. Predicate logic lives entirely in `src/lib/predicate.ts`, so
new predicate types (and new campaigns) require zero contract changes or
redeploys. All three campaigns above ran through the same `create_campaign`
entrypoint on the one deployed contract.

Machine-readable copy in [`strk20.json`](strk20.json). Exceeds the ≥3 real
mainnet transaction requirement.

**Scope note:** all 7 transactions are against `ProvaPass` (the contract
this project built), not direct calls into the STRK20 pool contract — see
"Attempted: pool-touching transactions" below for why, and the README's
"What is private / what is not" for the full trust-boundary writeup. Prova
reads the pool's public `Deposit` events; it does not submit transactions
to it.

## What shipped in this pass (capability-layer generalization)

Starting point was a single hardcoded campaign type ("held X for N days").
This pass turned that into a general primitive:

- **3 predicate types**, all evaluated from the same honest public-data
  source (pool `Deposit` events), pluggable via
  `src/lib/predicate.ts::evaluatePredicate` — `held_since`,
  `balance_threshold`, `deposit_count`.
- **Generic claim kind** — `capability` (nullifier consumed, nothing
  transferred: an allowlist entry or provable one-time action) vs.
  `reward_token` (contract also pays out `reward_amount`). Same contract
  entrypoint, driven by whether `reward_amount` is zero.
- **Literal bearer-token transferability**: a pass was always just
  `(campaignId, nullifier)` plus a server-side lookup — nothing in the
  original design bound it to a wallet or browser session. This pass makes
  that explicit: the UI can export a pass as a copyable token and redeem
  one pasted in from anywhere, with zero prior connection to the session
  that generated it. No backend change was needed — `/api/claim` already
  accepted `(campaignId, nullifier, recipient)` from any caller.
- **Multi-pass UI**: a user can hold several outstanding passes across
  different campaigns at once, tracked client-side (localStorage) since
  Prova has no account system and — by design — cannot correlate passes to
  identities server-side without breaking the privacy property.
- **A visual hero**: the app now leads with an explicit Wallet A → Pass →
  Wallet B diagram that highlights the current stage of the flow, making
  the unlinkable cross-wallet claim the first thing a viewer sees, not a
  paragraph they have to read to understand.

None of this required a contract redeploy — see "Live campaigns" above for
why that's true, not just convenient.

## Attempted: pool-touching transactions

Investigated again for this pass, not just carried over from earlier
findings:

- Re-checked `github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-privacy` directly: the
  "Transaction Prover" is listed only as a Docker image tag
  (`ghcr.io/starkware-libs/starknet-privacy/transaction-prover`), with no
  public endpoint URL anywhere in the repo.
- Checked the hackathon repo's open issues for prover-access threads.
  Found three: #204, #147, #121, all asking the same question from
  different angles. **Issue #147** ("Privacy SDK route — proving service
  access for mainnet (and Sepolia)"), opened Aug 20 2026 — six days before
  this pass — explicitly asks "The Day-0 guide says the mainnet proving URL
  isn't published and to ask via issue — could you share access details?"
  It has **zero replies** as of this write-up.
- `strk20.starknet.io/build` and `strk20-by-example.org` (the two docs
  sites referenced by the hackathon repo) are both outside this build
  environment's network allowlist and could not be checked directly; no
  secondhand evidence from GitHub search suggests either publishes an
  endpoint.

Conclusion: the gap is real, current, and not specific to this team — other
participants hit the identical wall and got no response either. We did not
fake a pool-touching transaction to paper over this. If the prover becomes
reachable, the only code that changes is `src/lib/predicate.ts` (see
README "The attester today, and what replaces it") — the contract and
claim flow need no changes at all.

## Sprint requirements checklist

- [x] Public GitHub repo with license (MIT; vendored StarkWare code keeps
      its own Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`)
- [x] ≥3 real mainnet transactions (7, listed above)
- [x] Live public demo URL (https://provah.vercel.app/)
- [x] 3-minute demo script (`DEMO.md`)
- [x] Complete `strk20.json`
- [x] README explains what's private vs. public
- [x] Full user flow works live: generate a pass from one wallet, claim
      from a different, unfunded wallet, gas-sponsored by Prova
- [x] Multiple campaign/predicate types, not a single hardcoded demo
- [x] Literal, demoable pass transferability (bearer-token export/redeem)

## Known limitation: predicate check is a server attestation, not a client-side ZK proof

The one honest gap between this v1 and the fully trustless design it's
built for. See README "The attester today, and what replaces it" for the
full writeup, including exactly which files would change (`predicate.ts`
only — the contract's signature check already supports swapping in a real
verifier or a prover-controlled key with no changes to the nullifier
registry or claim flow).

## Architecture

See the README's "Architecture" section for the full data-flow diagram and
component breakdown.

## Environment constraint (development only, does not affect the live demo)

This project's dev sandbox has outbound network access limited to
github.com, npm/pypi, and the Anthropic API — it cannot reach Starknet RPC
nodes or vercel.com directly. All mainnet transactions above were executed
via `.github/workflows/mainnet-admin.yml` (`scripts/mainnet-admin.mjs`), a
`workflow_dispatch` action running on a GitHub-hosted runner with full
internet access. The live app itself (Vercel) talks to Starknet RPC and
Neon Postgres directly at runtime — this constraint is specific to the
build environment, not the deployed product.
